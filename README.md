- Approximately 1500 employees are eligible to be mentors
- Eligible mentors are from various departments including senior engineers and senior staff

## Summary
There are roughly 100,000 employees eligible for retirement, yet only about 1500 employees that are eligible to be mentors. Luckily, as depicted in the first image, mentors are eligible from a variety of departments. However, this drastic gap could prove problematic for Pewlett-Hackard. There could be a large knowledge gap between retiring and less experienced employees. Thus, I recommend Pewlett-Hackard convince less employees to retire with promotions or flexible working hours and increase the mentorship eligiblity year range. The current mentorship eligibility year range is shown in the second query image below.
